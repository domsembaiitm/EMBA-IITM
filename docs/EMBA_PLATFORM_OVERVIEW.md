# DoMS IIT Madras: EMBA Talent Discovery Platform

## What is this?
This is a dedicated digital portal to showcase the profiles of the **DoMS IIT Madras Executive MBA Program** to the corporate world.

Think of it as a specialized, "cohort-only" LinkedIn. It is a single link that can be shared with recruiters, alumni networks, and industry partners to give them a comprehensive view of the talent available in our executive batches.

## Why did we build it?
Standard resumes and LinkedIn profiles often fail to capture the specific value of an EMBA candidate.
1.  **Experience Gap**: Recruiters often see only the "Technical Manager" title from the past, missing the "Strategic Leader" growth happening during the EMBA.
2.  **Depth**: A 2-page PDF cannot adequately display Capstone projects, research papers, or the distinct "Thinking Style" that defines a senior leader.
3.  **Access**: We wanted to make it frictionless for hiring partners to browse the batch without needing to log in or download 50 different PDFs.

## Key Features

### 1. The "Transformation" Profile
Unlike a standard CV that lists job history chronologically, the profile here highlights the **Transformation Narrative**. It explicitly frames the candidate's journey from their past operational roles to their future strategic potential.

### 2. Leadership DNA (Thinking Style)
Each student profile includes a unique "Thinking Style" section. This visualizes the candidate's approach to risk (Conservative vs. Bold) and leadership (Consensus vs. Directive). This helps recruiters identify cultural fit immediately—for example, matching a "Maverick" leader with an innovation role.

### 3. Project Portfolio
Students can upload and display their key course deliverables and Capstone projects. This provides tangible proof of their ability to apply academic concepts to real-world business problems.

### 4. Direct Connection
Recruiters can browse the cohort freely. If they are interested in a candidate, they can try to "Connect" or "Request Introduction", which logs their interest. The student then decides whether to engage.

## Privacy & Control
We understand that many cohort members are currently employed and may not want to be visibly "Open to Work".
*   **Default Privacy**: Profiles can be kept private (visible only to you).
*   **Public Visibility**: You can toggle "Enable Public Visibility" when you are ready to be seen by external recruiters.

## Intended Use
This platform is meant to be a tool for the Placement Committee and individual students to amplify their reach.
*   **Placement Team**: Share the main "Discover" link with corporate partners.
*   **Students**: Share your unique profile URL in emails or LinkedIn DMs to standout from other applicants.
